# Self-update a running firstmate and its secondmates to the latest origin.
#
# Mechanical half of the /updatefirstmate skill. Fast-forwards the running
# firstmate repo's default branch from origin, then this home's private add-on
# checkout from its own origin (bin/fm-addon.sh), then every registered
# secondmate home; a remote one also fast-forwards its own add-on.
#
# Self-update source. The optional local, gitignored, not-inherited
# $FM_HOME/config/self-update-source replaces origin as the source for this
# command ONLY. It holds one line, "<remote> <branch>", naming a remote that
# already exists in this repository and a branch on it (for example a fork
# branch carrying unmerged fixes on top of upstream). When it is present:
#   - the primary fetches exactly that branch into refs/remotes/<remote>/<branch>
#     and fast-forwards to it under the same guards as the origin path;
#   - local secondmates advance to the primary's resulting default-branch commit
#     (the same commit the startup secondmate sync follows), importing it from
#     the primary first when a standalone clone lacks it;
#   - a remote secondmate is unchanged: its host runs its own copy of this
#     command, which reads the config of that host's code root, so a remote
#     home follows the source only when that code root has the same file.
# Absent, behaviour is exactly the origin path. A present but unreadable or
# malformed file, an unknown remote, or an invalid branch name stops the whole
# update before anything moves; it never falls back to origin. Nothing else
# reads the file: worker spawns, review diffs, the cleanup landed-work test,
# lint, and default-branch detection keep using origin. The fast-forward-only
# guards still apply, so the named branch must only ever move forward. The
# source follows a branch, not a release, so it combines only with the main
# update channel: a home whose channel (config/update-channel or --channel) is a
# release is refused before anything moves rather than silently picking one. The
# private add-on keeps following its own origin either way.
#
# Local homes are treehouse worktrees or standalone clones; remote routes update
# their configured code root on that host and then fast-forward the persistent
# home to that root. FAST-FORWARD ONLY, exactly like
# fm-fleet-sync.sh: never force, never create a merge commit, never stash.
# A secondmate divergence whose complete local tree result is already present at
# the target is reconciled with reset --keep; every other unsafe target is
# skipped and reported, with divergence recorded durably by fm-ff-lib.sh.
# A tracked-files update never touches the gitignored operational
# dirs (data/, state/, config/, projects/, .no-mistakes/), so a secondmate's
# in-flight work is never disrupted. Worktrees of this repo share one object
# store, so a single fetch refreshes them all; standalone-clone homes are
# fetched on their own. Secondmate homes are leased at a detached HEAD on the
# default branch, so a fast-forward there advances HEAD only and never touches
# any other worktree's checkout or the shared `main` branch.
#
# The fast-forward mechanics live in bin/fm-ff-lib.sh (base_mode "origin" here);
# the same library drives local and remote parent-targeted secondmate sync, so
# there is one ff implementation, not several.
#
# It does NOT re-read AGENTS.md or nudge secondmates itself - those are LLM /
# tmux actions the skill performs. The script's job is the safe git mechanics
# plus a parseable summary telling the caller what to do next:
#   - one status line per target (updated/already current/skipped)
#   - reread-firstmate: yes|no    (did the running firstmate's instructions change)
#   - restart-secondmates: fm-<id>...|none (every live secondmate this pass left
#     on the update target's tip - advanced OR already there - whose recorded
#     runtime can prove a restart)
#   - nudge-secondmates: fm-<id>...|none   (the residual: live secondmates on
#     that same tip whose runtime CANNOT prove a restart, so the older re-read
#     steer is all that is honest for them)
#
# The two sets are disjoint, and restart is UNCONDITIONAL on a successful update
# of that home. It is deliberately not gated on the git diff: replacing the agent
# is the only thing that re-resolves the launch-time wiring - turn-end hooks,
# harness flags, per-harness feature switches - which a running agent froze when
# it started and which no changed_instr list describes. An unchanged tracked
# surface therefore is NOT evidence that the running agent is already on the
# current behavior, so an ALREADY-CURRENT home restarts too.
#
# Only two things keep a live mate out of the restart set, and neither is papered
# over as a reload:
#   - its home was SKIPPED (dirty, uniquely diverged, offline, unsafe). It is not
#     on the new bytes, nothing here forces, stashes, or discards it, and it gets
#     no action at all. A divergence remains in the durable reconciliation record
#     that this or a later bootstrap/update pass surfaces.
#   - its runtime cannot prove the old agent stopped and a replacement came up
#     (bin/fm-secondmate-restart-lib.sh owns that test), so it falls to the
#     honest re-read steer and is reported as a nudge, never as a reload.
# A positively dead or missing endpoint has no agent to replace and is left to
# the ordinary startup recovery.
#
# A fast-forward that lands changes bytes under bin/ in place, which desyncs
# the trust binding of any locally armed fm-procevent-when watch whose action
# executable lives in the updated repo; left alone, the watch's next fire
# would be wrongly refused. After each home's own update (primary and every
# local secondmate), this script best-effort runs that home's own
# fm-procevent-when.sh rebind-all to republish those bindings against the new
# bytes; a failure there is swallowed rather than failing the update.
#
# Update channel: the home's config/update-channel (docs/configuration.md
# "Update channel"; parsing in bin/fm-release-lib.sh) chooses what this pass
# follows. Absent or "main" is the behavior above, unchanged. "release" follows
# the newest release tag on origin's default branch, ignoring names more than a
# month ahead (bin/fm-release-lib.sh), and a release name stays on that one
# release. A home behind the target release fast-forwards onto it. An update
# never moves a home back: a home already past it only by commits on origin's
# default branch, such as a fresh install on main's tip, is skipped and stays
# where it is until a newer release passes it, and only --step-back goes back;
# a home with any commit not on origin is skipped as diverged exactly as on main.
# The primary resolves the release once, and every local and remote secondmate
# follows that same release under the same never-back rule, because a
# secondmate ahead of its primary would later read as diverged to the
# primary-commit sync. The private add-on keeps following its own origin's
# default branch. A malformed channel file refuses the whole pass before
# anything moves.
#
# --step-back moves a home on the release channel back exactly one release: from
# a release to the one before it, or from a home that is not on a release, to
# the newest release behind it. It refuses unless the home is clean, on its
# default branch, holds no commit that is not on origin's default branch, has a
# release behind it, and has no second mates (a home with them holds its
# current release instead by writing that release's name into
# config/update-channel), then moves the default branch to that release with
# reset --keep (every commit it leaves is on origin's default branch, so no
# local work can be lost) and writes that release name into
# config/update-channel, so later updates stay there until the operator writes
# "release" again. It prints the same reread/restart/nudge summary.
#
# Usage: fm-update.sh [--channel main|<starship-YYYY.MM[.N]>]
#        fm-update.sh --step-back
#        fm-update.sh --help
# --channel makes this one pass follow main or the named release instead of
# reading config/update-channel; a parent passes its own channel to a remote
# secondmate's code-root update. It accepts only main or a release name.
