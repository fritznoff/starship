# Scan tracked files for captain-private PII and live-token shapes.
#
# CI entry point for the public-repo leak guard.
# Pattern ownership for email and /Users/<name> lives in bin/fm-leak-lib.sh
# (shared with fm-home-port.sh --warn-machine-local).
# Fails when a tracked file (outside the explicit allowlist) contains:
#   - a real email address (placeholder domains are allowed)
#   - a macOS absolute home path (/Users/<name>/...)
#   - a live-token shape matching the portable-home credential scan
#   - a customer data shape, such as a Slack id or a phone number (NEW NAMES
#     AND DATA SHAPES below)
#   - a word or phrase from the home's private word list (below)
#
# The credential half reuses the same token regex family as scan_path() in
# bin/fm-home-port.sh so both gates stay aligned.
# tests/ fixtures that intentionally embed synthetic tokens are allowlisted.
# This script, bin/fm-leak-lib.sh, and bin/fm-home-port.sh are allowlisted
# because they embed pattern strings.
#
# PRIVATE WORDS. The patterns above cannot know a person's names, projects or
# plans, so a home may list them in the optional, gitignored config/leak-words:
# one word or phrase per line, blank lines and lines starting with # ignored,
# matched case-insensitively as whole words. That list is checked against
# EVERY scanned file, tests/ and the allowlisted scripts included, because a
# fixture is exactly where a real name slips in. The home is FM_HOME when it is
# set, else the primary checkout this checkout is a worktree of (so a task
# worktree finds its home's list), else ~/starship, the default home, which is
# how a no-mistakes validation copy - a worktree of the gate's own bare mirror
# that belongs to no home - still finds it. The list a secondmate home inherits
# from its primary, config/leak-words.inherited, and a file named leak-words at
# the root of the home's private add-on (bin/fm-addon.sh), both in the same
# format, add their words to the home's own; fm_leak_words_write in
# bin/fm-leak-lib.sh owns that merge. No list means no word check; CI has none. A hit prints the offending
# line locally, so the words never leave this machine. bin/fm-lint.sh runs --private-words on every default lint, which is
# how the list is checked before each push.
#
#
# DRAFT TEXT. --text checks text that is about to be published rather than
# tracked files: a PR title, description or comment, or a no-mistakes intent.
# It reads each named file, or stdin when none is named or the name is -,
# checks only the private word list (with --new-names, also the new-name and
# shape checks below), and prints one
# `LEAK_HIT: private-word: <source>: <word>` line per distinct listed word the
# text contains (the source is the file as named, or stdin), so the writer
# knows exactly what to take out. bin/fm-pr-text-guard.py runs it on what a
# spawned Claude worker is about to publish, and the ship brief tells every
# worker to run it on draft PR text first.
#
# NEW NAMES AND DATA SHAPES. A list cannot keep up with the names a home works
# with, so a home that keeps one (or an approvals file, below) also refuses any
# name-shaped word that has never appeared in this repository before, until the
# owner approves it once. --new-names checks the lines this checkout adds since
# its merge base with origin/main, committed and uncommitted changes to tracked
# files, tests/ included, and the messages of the commits origin/main..HEAD,
# each hit there named as `commit <short-sha>`. A word that occurs
# anywhere in the tracked files at the merge base is never new, so once a change
# lands its words stop being new. bin/fm-leak-shapes.py owns what counts as
# name-shaped and as an occurrence. The approvals file is the home's optional,
# gitignored config/leak-names-approved, one word per line in the word list's
# format; firstmate appends a word there once the owner approves it, and the
# guard never prints the file. The same added lines, and every scanned file in
# the default scan, are checked for the shapes customer data takes: Slack ids
# and workspace links, HubSpot record and portal links, phone numbers in
# international form or as a Dutch mobile number (06 and 8 digits) and IBANs,
# which bin/fm-leak-shapes.py also owns, with the same allowlist as the other
# patterns; commit messages have no allowlist. bin/fm-lint.sh runs --new-names on every
# default lint, so the pipeline's lint step checks each push; without a list or
# approvals file, as in CI, it is silent. Each hit prints
# `LEAK_HIT: new-name: <path>:<line>: <word>` or `LEAK_HIT: <shape>: ...`.
# Without origin/main, or without a merge base with it, --new-names exits 2.
# --text --new-names adds the same two checks to a draft text, with the tracked
# files at this checkout's HEAD as what is already known, and, when the caller's
# working directory is in a checkout that shares a remote's owner/repo with this
# one and has a commit, the tracked files at that checkout's HEAD too, so the words of the branch
# being published count as known; bin/fm-pr-text-guard.py uses it for text
# bound for this repository and runs it from the publishing command's directory.
#
# Usage:
#   fm-leak-guard.sh                  scan the whole tracked tree (what CI runs)
#   fm-leak-guard.sh <path>...        scan only the given paths (developer convenience)
#   fm-leak-guard.sh --private-words [<path>...]
#                                     check only the private word list, and
#                                     exit 0 silently when this home has none
#   fm-leak-guard.sh --text [--new-names] [<file>|-]...
#                                     check draft text against the private word
#                                     list, and with --new-names for new names
#                                     and data shapes too: exit 1 naming each
#                                     hit, 0 when clean, and 0 silently when
#                                     this home has no list or approvals file
#   fm-leak-guard.sh --new-names
#                                     check the lines and commit messages this
#                                     checkout adds for new names and data
#                                     shapes: exit 1 naming each hit, 2 when no
#                                     merge base with origin/main is found, and
#                                     0 silently without a list or approvals file
