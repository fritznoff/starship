# Pattern ownership for email and /Users/<name> lives in bin/fm-leak-lib.sh
# (shared with fm-home-port.sh --warn-machine-local).
# Fails when a tracked file (outside the explicit allowlist) contains:
#   - a real email address (placeholder domains are allowed)
#   - a macOS absolute home path (/Users/<name>/...)
#   - a live key or token shape (bin/fm_secret_shapes.py owns the provider
#     prefixes, shared with the command guard's redaction; bin/fm-leak-shapes.py
#     adds API key assignments in any case and reports each)
#   - a customer data shape, such as a Slack id or a phone number (NEW NAMES
#     AND DATA SHAPES below)
#   - a word or phrase from the home's private word list (below)
#
# tests/ fixtures that intentionally embed synthetic tokens are allowlisted.
# This script, bin/fm-leak-lib.sh, and bin/fm-home-port.sh are allowlisted
# because they embed pattern strings.
#
# PRIVATE WORDS. The patterns above cannot know a person's names, projects or
# plans, so a home may list them in the optional, gitignored config/leak-words:
# one word or phrase per line, blank lines and lines starting with # ignored,
# matched case-insensitively as whole words. That list is checked against
# EVERY scanned file, tests/ and the allowlisted scripts included, because a
# fixture is exactly where a real name slips in. The home is FM_HOME when it is
# set, else the primary checkout this checkout is a worktree of (so a task
# worktree finds its home's list), else ~/starship, the default home, which is
# how a no-mistakes validation copy - a worktree of the gate's own bare mirror
# that belongs to no home - still finds it. The list a secondmate home inherits
# from its primary, config/leak-words.inherited, and a file named leak-words at
# the root of the home's private add-on (bin/fm-addon.sh), both in the same
# format, add their words to the home's own; fm_leak_words_write in
# bin/fm-leak-lib.sh owns that merge. No list means no word check; CI has none.
# bin/fm-lint.sh runs --private-words on every default lint, which is how the
# list is checked before each push.
#
# WHERE, NEVER WHAT. A private word or a token is reported only by where it
# sits, `LEAK_HIT: private-word: <where>:<line>:<column>` or `LEAK_HIT: token:
# <where>:<line>:<column>`, and a failure counts them; neither the word, the
# token nor its line is ever printed, so checking a file that holds the word
# list itself does not put the list on the screen. Other hits print the
# offending line or value locally.
#
#
# DRAFT TEXT. --text checks text that is about to be published rather than
# tracked files: a PR title, description or comment, or a no-mistakes intent.
# It reads each named file, or stdin when none is named or the name is -,
# checks the private word list and the token shapes (with --new-names, also the
# new-name and shape checks below), and prints one
# `LEAK_HIT: private-word: <source>:<line>:<column>` or `LEAK_HIT: token:
# <source>:<line>:<column>` line per occurrence (the source is the file as
# named, or stdin), so the writer knows exactly where to take one out.
# Without a list or approvals file only the token shapes are checked, and a
# clean text then passes silently. bin/fm-pr-text-guard.py runs it on what a
# Claude session is about to publish, and the ship brief tells every worker
# to run it on draft PR text first.
#
# NEW NAMES AND DATA SHAPES. A list cannot keep up with the names a home works
# with, so a home that keeps one (or an approvals file, below) also refuses any
# name-shaped word that has never appeared in this repository before, until the
# owner approves it once. --new-names checks the lines this checkout adds since
# its merge base with origin/main, committed and uncommitted changes to tracked
# files, tests/ included, and the messages of the commits origin/main..HEAD,
# each hit there named as `commit <short-sha>`. A word that occurs
# anywhere in the tracked files at the merge base is never new, so once a change
# lands its words stop being new. bin/fm-leak-shapes.py owns what counts as
# name-shaped and as an occurrence. The approvals file is the home's optional,
# gitignored config/leak-names-approved, one word per line in the word list's
# format; firstmate appends a word there once the owner approves it, and the
# guard never prints the file. The same added lines, and every scanned file in
# the default scan, are checked for the shapes customer data takes: Slack ids
# and workspace links, HubSpot record and portal links, phone numbers in
# international form or as a Dutch mobile number (06 and 8 digits) and IBANs,
# which bin/fm-leak-shapes.py also owns, with the same allowlist as the other
# patterns; commit messages have no allowlist. bin/fm-lint.sh runs --new-names on every
# default lint, so the pipeline's lint step checks each push; without a list or
# approvals file, as in CI, it is silent. Each hit prints
# `LEAK_HIT: new-name: <path>:<line>: <word>` or `LEAK_HIT: <shape>: ...`. A
# word or phrase from the private word list in those added lines or commit
# messages is placed as `LEAK_HIT: private-word: <where>:<line>:<column>` and
# never printed, and no word inside it is named as new.
# Without origin/main, or without a merge base with it, --new-names exits 2.
#
# UPSTREAM CONTENT. A fork that records the upstream it tracks as
# upstream_base in fork-surface.conf (bin/fm-fork-surface.sh owns that file)
# merges the upstream's public content, which this home cannot rewrite. So
# --new-names also counts every word in the tracked files at that commit as
# known, and does not check the messages of commits reachable from it for new
# names. Everything else stays as strict: those messages and the lines the
# upstream adds are still checked for private words, customer data shapes and
# token shapes, and this home's own lines and commit messages for new names. A
# recorded base that is not a commit in this checkout, or that already holds
# the branch's merge base with origin/main and so is not upstream content, is
# named on stderr and ignored; with none recorded nothing changes.
# --text --new-names adds the same two checks to a draft text, with the tracked
# files at this checkout's HEAD as what is already known, and, when the caller's
# working directory is in a checkout that shares a remote's owner/repo with this
# one and has a commit, the tracked files at that checkout's HEAD too, so the words of the branch
# being published count as known; bin/fm-pr-text-guard.py uses it for text
# bound for this repository and runs it from the publishing command's directory.
#

#                                     check only the private word list, and

#                                     --new-names for new names and data shapes
#                                     too: exit 1 placing each hit, 0 when
#                                     clean, silently when this home has no
#                                     list or approvals file, and 2 when the
