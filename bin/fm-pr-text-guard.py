# fm-pr-text-guard.py - the PR text check: before a Claude session publishes
# text to a public repository's pull requests, it refuses the command when the
# text holds a word from this home's private word list or a live key or token
# shape, and, when that repository is this Starship repository, a word that
# never appeared in it before or a customer data shape (bin/fm-leak-guard.sh
# --new-names).
#
# Usage:
#   fm-pr-text-guard.py hook --home DIR
#       The Claude Code PreToolUse hook on Bash that bin/fm-spawn.sh installs
#       for every spawned Claude worker (ship or scout), and that
#       bin/fm-pr-text-pretool-check.sh runs for a first mate or second mate
#       session from the tracked .claude/settings.json. Reads the hook payload
#       on stdin. On a refusal it prints the documented PreToolUse deny object
#       on stdout; on an allow it prints nothing. It always exits 0.
#
# docs/configuration.md "Private leak words" owns the operator contract. The
# word list, its format and where it is found belong to bin/fm-leak-guard.sh,
# whose --text mode this hook runs with FM_HOME set to DIR from the command's
# working directory, so the words of the branch checked out there count as
# known to this repository; this file never reads the list itself.
#
# WHERE, NEVER WHAT. A refusal says how many listed words and token shapes the
# text holds and where, as the command or a file it names and the line, and
# never the words or tokens themselves, so a command that names the word list
# file does not put the list on the screen. New words, which the owner must
# approve by name, and customer data shapes are named.
#
# WHAT IS CHECKED. Only a Bash command that publishes text: gh or gh-axi
# `pr|issue create|new|edit|comment|review|close|reopen|merge`, a `gh api` call that sends
# fields or an input file, and `no-mistakes axi run|respond`, whose intent and
# answers reach the PR the pipeline writes. Every other command passes
# untouched, and so does every other tool. The text checked is the whole
# command, so inline titles, bodies, heredocs and variables set earlier in the
# same command all count, plus every existing file the command names anywhere:
# a body or input flag, a redirect, a `cat` or `$(cat ...)`, or a pipe into
# `--body-file -`. A listed word in a path or branch name of such a command is
# refused too, because a branch name is published. Token shapes are checked
# only in the command and in the files it sends as content: a --body-file, -F
# or --input value, an @file value of -f, -F, --field or --raw-field, a
# `$(cat FILE)`, `$(<FILE)` or backtick `cat FILE` outside single quotes and
# quoted heredoc bodies, a `< FILE` redirect into, or the files
# of a `cat FILE |` stage piped into, a command reading --body-file - or
# --input -, or every file it names when its words cannot be parsed. A file it merely names,
# such as a test fixture with synthetic keys, is checked for every other hit. A `pr create` or `pr new` given
# --fill, -f, --fill-first or --fill-verbose before the next shell operator
# takes its text from commit messages this check cannot see, so on a public
# repository it is refused whenever the home has a list.
#
# PUBLIC ONLY. A private repository may hold these words, so a hit is refused
# unless every repository the command could reach is proven private. A new word
# or data shape is refused only on a public repository that one of the remotes
# of this script's own checkout points at, by the owner/repo gh reports for it,
# or on one whose visibility or name cannot be read; other public repositories
# may hold them. When the
# command calls gh or gh-axi as a word of its own, or names a publishing gh
# form that is not part of a no-mistakes command, those repositories are every
# --repo/-R value, GH_REPO= value, PR or issue URL argument and
# repos/<owner>/<repo> path among its words, plus gh's own default for the
# working directory, which `gh repo view` reads there. A gh form named only
# inside quoted text of a no-mistakes command, such as its intent, adds none.
# For `no-mistakes axi run|respond`, the repository is the owner/repo of the
# origin remote, whether its host is github.com or a dotless SSH alias; an
# origin on any other dotted host is not checked, and one that cannot be
# parsed is refused. A command whose words cannot be parsed while it names a
# gh form, often because of an unmatched quote in a heredoc or comment, counts
# as possibly public and is refused, placing the listed words, so the worker
# rewrites the text without them, or drops such comments and passes the text
# with --body-file <file> and an explicit --repo. Such a command that names a
# `pr create` or `pr new` form and a standalone --fill flag counts as --fill.
# A repository whose visibility cannot be
# read, and an origin that cannot be parsed, count as possibly public too: the
# refusal places the words and names that repository, and tells the worker to rewrite
# the text without them, or to append a blocked: status line and stop when the
# repository is private and still cannot be read. The visibility read happens
# only after a hit, so a clean command costs no network call.
#
# FAILURES. No list means only token shapes are checked: bin/fm-leak-guard.sh
# --text says nothing at all for a clean text then, and nothing is refused. An
# unreadable payload passes, because it cannot be known to publish anything.
# Once a command is known to publish, any failure inside the check refuses it.
# Every call the check makes shares one deadline, BUDGET seconds from the
# start (FM_PR_TEXT_GUARD_BUDGET when set), well inside the hook timeout
# bin/fm-spawn.sh sets, so the check refuses when time runs out instead of
# being cut off by the hook timeout, which would let the command run.
