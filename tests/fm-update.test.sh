# Tests for bin/fm-update.sh: fast-forward-only self-update of a running
# firstmate repo and every registered secondmate home.
#
# The guarantees under test mirror fm-fleet-sync.sh and prime directive #3:
#   - The running firstmate repo (on its default branch) fast-forwards from
#     origin; a leased secondmate home (detached HEAD on the default branch)
#     fast-forwards the same way.
#   - A dirty, offline, wrong-branch, or genuinely unique diverged target is
#     skipped and reported, never forced or stashed, so unlanded work survives.
#     Divergence leaves a durable reconciliation record, while a clean local
#     result already present upstream after a squash merge heals automatically.
#   - The update is a single-parent fast-forward (never a merge commit) and a
#     fast-forward of one worktree never disturbs another worktree's checkout
#     or the shared default branch.
#   - The caller-action summary is correct: reread-firstmate flips to yes only
#     when the instruction surface (AGENTS.md / bin / .agents/skills) changed, and
#     the two secondmate action sets are disjoint and correctly gated -
#     restart-secondmates carries EVERY live mate this pass left on origin's tip
#     whose recorded runtime can prove a restart, INCLUDING one that was already
#     there and one whose advance touched no instruction surface, because a
#     restart is also what re-resolves launch-time harness wiring; a live mate
#     whose runtime cannot prove a restart falls to nudge-secondmates; and a mate
#     whose home was skipped or whose endpoint is stopped gets no action at all.
#   - Secondmate homes resolve from both state/<id>.meta and the
#     data/secondmates.md registry, deduped, and the firstmate repo is never
#     re-processed as one of its own secondmates.
#   - A home's private add-on (bin/fm-addon.sh) fast-forwards from its own
#     origin under the same guards, a remote home's add-on line is relayed, and
#     a home with no add-on prints nothing about one.
#   - An optional config/self-update-source moves the primary to that one remote
#     branch instead of origin, under the same fast-forward guards, and local
#     secondmates (linked worktree or standalone clone) follow the primary's
#     resulting commit; an unusable file refuses the whole update before
#     anything moves rather than falling back to origin.
